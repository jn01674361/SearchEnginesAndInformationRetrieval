notes

Computer_Science was difficult because it is a graduate program related to mathematics, but it is probably not what you are looking for when performing that search.

Elaine_Kasimatis was difficult because it is highly relevant if you are considering taking the mathematics graduate program but are not sure, but not as relevant if you are merely looking for practical information about the program.

Biological_Systems_Engineering could be relevant because it does include mathematics and is a graduate program, however, if you were interested in that kind of stuff, you would probably include "biology" in your query.
